qaac - CLI QuickTime AAC/ALAC encoder
=====================================

How to build
------------
You need QuickTime SDK 7.3 for Windows to build qaac. You can download QuickTime SDK from http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/ (registration is required).

SDK is installed under C:/Program Files/QuickTime SDK (or C:/Program Files (x86)/QuickTime SDK, if you are using 64bit OS).

You have to modify qaac.props, if your SDK install directory is different from the project settings.
